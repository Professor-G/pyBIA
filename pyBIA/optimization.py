def strawman_imputation(data):
    """
    Perform Strawman imputation, a time-efficient algorithm
    in which missing data values are replaced with the median
    value of the entire, non-NaN sample. If the data is a hot-encoded
    boolean (as the RF does not allow True or False), then the 
    instance that is used the most will be computed as the median. 

    This is the baseline algorithm used by (Tang & Ishwaran 2017).
    See: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05305.pdf

    Note:
        This function assumes each row corresponds to one sample, and 
        that missing values are masked as either NaN or inf. 

    Args:
        data (ndarray): 1D array if single parameter is input. If
            data is 2-dimensional, the medians will be calculated
            using the non-missing values in each corresponding column.

    Returns:
        The data array with the missing values filled in.

def KNN_imputation(data, imputer=None, k=3):
    """
    Performs k-Nearest Neighbor imputation and transformation.
    By default the imputer will be created and returned, unless
    the imputer argument is set, in which case only the transformed
    data is output. 

    As this bundles neighbors according to their eucledian distance,
    it is sensitive to outliers. Can also yield weak predictions if the
    training features are heaviliy correlated.
    
    Args:
        imputer (optional): A KNNImputer class instance, configured using sklearn.impute.KNNImputer.
            Defaults to None, in which case the transformation is created using
            the data itself. 
        data (ndarray): 1D array if single parameter is input. If
            data is 2-dimensional, the medians will be calculated
            using the non-missing values in each corresponding column.
        k (int, optional): If knn_imputer is None, this is the number
            of neighrest neighbors to consider when computing the imputation.
            Defaults to 3. If knn_imputer argument is set, this variable is ignored.

    Note:
        Tang & Ishwaran 2017 reported that if there is low to medium
        correlation in the dataset, RF imputation algorithms perform 
        better than KNN imputation

    Example:
        If we have our training data in an array called training_set, we 
        can create the imputer so that we can call it to transform new data
        when making on-the-field predictions.

        >>> imputed_data, knn_imputer = knn_imputation(data=training_set, imputer=None)
        
        Now we can use the imputed data to create our machine learning model.
        Afterwards, when new data is input for prediction, we will insert our 
        imputer into the pipelinen by calling this function again, but this time
        with the imputer argument set:

        >>> new_data = knn_imputation(new_data, imputer=knn_imputer)

    Returns:
        The first output is the data array with with the missing values filled in. 
        The second output is the KNN Imputer that should be used to transform
        new data, prior to predictions.
